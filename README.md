Just a little greasemonkey script that enchances Multistre.am

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress and currently only works on the 4 up with Main layout. I might or might not enchance it in the future.

Features added:
1) Audio & chat rotate when you click the "Rotate Streams" button to sync with the video. Can rotate with the "r" key.
2) Show/Hide chat frame, allowing the main window to be wider.
3) Sets video quality to "Source"
